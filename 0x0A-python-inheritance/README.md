# 0x0A-python-inheritance
Inheritance is an important concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows classes to inherit attributes and methods from other classes. 
In Python, you can create a new class by deriving it from an existing class, 
which is known as the superclass or base class. The newly created class is called the subclass or derived class.

To establish inheritance in Python, you define the derived class using the following syntax:

```python
class DerivedClass(BaseClass):
    # class definition
```
The derived class inherits all the attributes and methods from the base class. 
It can also add its own attributes and methods or override the ones inherited from the base class.
