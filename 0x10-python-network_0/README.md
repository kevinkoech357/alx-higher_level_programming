|   URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is a web address that specifies the location of a resource on the internet.

    HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is a protocol used for transmitting data over the web, enabling the retrieval and display of web pages.

    Reading a URL involves understanding its components, such as the scheme, domain name, sub-domain, port number, query string, and more.

    The scheme in an HTTP URL specifies the protocol being used, typically "http://" for unencrypted web traffic.

    A domain name is a human-readable label for a website's IP address, making it easier to access websites.

    A sub-domain is a part of a larger domain, often used for organizing content or services within a website.

    Port numbers in a URL can be defined to specify different services or applications running on the same server.

    A query string in a URL contains parameters and values that provide additional information to web servers.

    An HTTP request is a message sent from a client (e.g., a web browser) to a server, requesting a resource or action.

    An HTTP response is the server's reply to an HTTP request, containing the requested resource or information.

    HTTP headers are metadata included in requests and responses, providing additional information about the data being transmitted.

    The HTTP message body contains the actual data being sent in an HTTP request or response.

    HTTP request methods (e.g., GET, POST) specify the type of action to be performed on a resource.

    HTTP response status codes indicate the outcome of an HTTP request (e.g., 200 for success, 404 for not found).

    An HTTP Cookie is a small piece of data stored on a user's device by a website to track user preferences and state.

    cURL is a command-line tool used to make HTTP requests and retrieve data from web servers.

    When you type "google.com" in your browser, it triggers an application-level process where the browser sends an HTTP request to the Google server, which responds with the Google homepage for display in the browser.
