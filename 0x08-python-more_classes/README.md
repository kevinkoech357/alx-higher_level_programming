Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that provides a way to structure and organize code by using objects that encapsulate data and functionality. Python, as a versatile programming language, supports OOP concepts and allows developers to create classes, objects, and implement inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism. Here is a summary of OOP in Python:

## Classes: 
A class is a blueprint or template that defines the attributes (data) and methods (functions) that an object of that class will have. Classes in Python are defined using the class keyword.

## Objects: 
An object is an instance of a class. It represents a specific occurrence of a class with its own unique set of data and behavior. Objects are created using the class constructor, which initializes the object and allocates memory.

## Inheritance: 
Inheritance is a mechanism that allows classes to inherit attributes and methods from other classes. It promotes code reuse and enables the creation of hierarchical relationships between classes. A class that inherits from another class is called a subclass or derived class, while the class being inherited from is called a superclass or base class.

## Encapsulation: 
Encapsulation is the process of hiding the internal details of an object and providing a public interface to interact with it. It helps in achieving data abstraction and protects the data from unauthorized access. In Python, encapsulation is achieved by using access modifiers such as public, private, and protected.

## Polymorphism: 

Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It enables the same interface to be used for different types of objects, promoting code flexibility and extensibility. Polymorphism is achieved through method overriding and method overloading.

## Method Overriding: 
Method overriding is the ability of a subclass to provide a different implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass. The overridden method in the subclass is called instead of the superclass method when the method is called using an object of the subclass.

## Method Overloading: 
Method overloading is the ability to define multiple methods with the same name but different parameters within a class. Python does not support method overloading in the same way as some other languages, but you can achieve similar functionality using default parameter values or variable-length argument lists.
